# Colorblinder
[Rising Stack's guide to React Native] is very comprehensive.  However, it's API is very out of date.  This version is updated with the following

1. The new provider-consumer-based [React Navigation API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/navigation)
2. Expo's new [AppLoading component](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/app-loading/)
3. Expo's new hook-based [font API](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/font/)
